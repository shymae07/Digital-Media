  <h2> Toxicity</h2>
  <h3> System of a Down</h3>
  <p> Conversion, software 7.0 <br> Looking at the life through the eyes of a tire hub <br> eating seeds as a pastime activity <br> The toxicity of our city, our city</p>
  <p> You, what do you own the <em><strong> world?</strong></em> <br> How do you own <em>disorder? Disorder</em> <br> Now somewhere between the sacred silence <br> Scared silence and sleep <br> Somewhere, between the sacred silence and sleep <br> Disorder, disorder, disorder</p>
  <p> More wood for their fires, loud neighbors <br> Flashlight revieres caught in the headlights of a truck <br> Eating seeds is as a pastime activity <br> The toxicity of our city, of our city</p>
  <p> You, what do you own the <em> <strong>world?</strong></em> <br> How do you own <em> disorder? Disorder</em> <br> Now somewhere between the sared silence and sleep <br> Scared silence and sleep <br> Somewhere between the sacred silence and sleep <br> Disorder, disorder, disorder</p>
  <p> You, what do you own the <em><strong>world?</strong></em> <br> How do you own <em>disorder Disorder?</em> <br> Now somewhere between the sared silence and sleep <br> Scared  silence and sleep <br> Somewhere between the sacred silence and sleep <br> Disorder, disorder, disorder</p>
  <p> When I become the sun <br> I shone life into the man's hearts <br> When I became the sun <br> I shone life into the man's hearts</p>
